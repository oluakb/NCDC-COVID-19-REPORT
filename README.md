ABOUT THE PROJECT:
This project is my favourite data visualization using Powerbi. This is a interactive dashboard which features a covid - 19 dataset downloaded from https://lnkd.in/dpCRRCwB

First, the dataset was imported on excel and it was then imported into Powerbi for data cleansing and transformation. From there, amazing dashboard was created. 

This is more of a descriptive analysis in which insights below are derived.


*Cases on admission by states

*Cases of lab-confirmed by states

*Death cases by state

*No discharged cases by states

In conclusion, based on the data analysis, we can say Lagos state has the highest number of death cases, cases on admission confirmed cases, and no of people discharged.
